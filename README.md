- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joaolluiz. I’m 21 years old and I’m a technology enthusiast. I intend to work as a software developer and this is where I keep my study projects.
- 👀 I am interested in learning new technologies, knowledge and methods to constantly evolve in the field of programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing my studies on backend using the Java language and the entire Spring ecosystem. I have some repositories where I post personal study projects to train my backend skills. 
- 💞️ I am willing to hear feedbacks about my projects and how I can improve my codes so that they are more performant and cleaner :)
